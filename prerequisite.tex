\title{Security I -- Mathematical prerequisites}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Security I course relies on some mathematical background which students may not be familiar with.
This document seeks to cover that material and provide exercises which ensure that the material is well understood so that students can be confident that they will understand Security I.
I will provide some pointers to material which explains the concepts and a collection of exercises with solutions which should solidify understanding of the concepts.
\end{abstract}

The mathematics which you need to be comfortable with for Security I is discrete mathematics and probability.
Some of this is dull -- you need to learn some notation -- while other parts are more interesting.
The exercises will fall into three categories, bookwork questions (e.g.\ on definitions), usage questions where you will apply understanding to example problems and deeper understanding questions where proofs etc.\ will be required.
Answers will be provided (or cited) for all questions.
Clearly it is to your benefit to do the questions before looking at the answers.

{\bf Aim:} Students should be comfortable with working with these concepts in general and applying them in practise, both for use in cryptography and in other parts of Computer Science.
